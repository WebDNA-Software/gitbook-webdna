# The complete list of all WebDNA instructions

**Browser Info**

Often important in web development is to establish the browser information so that customised code can be targeted to certain browsers. The information gained can also be used to exclude some visitors based on their ip address or redirect browsers based on their connection method.

**Cookies**

HTTP cookies are data created by a web server and saved on a visitor's browser. WebDNA has the ability to easily save and retrieve cookies. From version 8.5 developers have the built in functionality to save cookies as both https or http only, save a cookie with MaxAge or save a cookie with any of the emerging cookie settings required.

**Databases & Tables**

WebDNA uses its own database system of tab-delimited text files operated in RAM, construct sophisticated database searches, resulting in formatted output. WebDNA tables can be used to quickly create a temporary 'in line' database that is local to the template and not part of the global database cache.

**Date & Time**

Date & time are the essence of everything that we do in life, WebDNA provides all the tools that you will require to manage date & time calculations and formatting.

**Encryption**

WebDNA allows you to quickly and easily store sensitive data in your databases, files and carts or send sensitive data over a network. There are a number of "best practice" encryption methods available in WebDNA.

**Files & Folders**

All the file & directory features a developer would ever need from creation to listing to copying to moving to deletion, all with the regular ease of using WebDNA.

**Grep & Regex**

grep and the new method of regex available from WebDNA v 8.1 provides developers with the often complex task of search and replace operations on data strings. The typical use case is to look for a sub-string that matches a pattern and replace it with something else.

**JSON**

Read, store and parse json with WebDNA to provide a seamless interface with most modern apis and javascript/jQuery in a lightweight format for storing and transporting data in the form of name/value pairs.

**Miscellaneous**

The multitude of functional tools that developrs require in the process of creating world class web site and B2B functions. WebDNA provides tools from simple "comments" to more complex function creation and storing of name/value pairs for specified recovery. These tools enable developers to get the job done with ease.

**Math**

What web site would not be complete without math calculations? From simple arithmetic addition and subtraction through to scientific calculation libraries, WebDNA's ease of use makes these sometimes daunting calculations far simpler to manage.

**Passwords**

Inbuilt methods of passing usernames and passwords to authenticate and protect sensitive web based data by using WebDNA to use its own methods or giving developers the tools to create their own methods.

**Searching**

Searching data is the basis of all dynamic websites. WebDNA has all the tools to enable you to build sophisticated database searches, resulting in formatted output, without the need for connecting to a separate database such as SQL by using WebDNA's own database system.

**Sessions**

Introduced in v8.1, is a WebDNA feature that recognises a browser through its "fingerprint", and thus eliminating the use of cookies in many cases. Server-side sessions are created when a visitor first hits a page generating a unique ID which remaining valid until the developer configured "lifetime" expires.

**Shopping**

Built dynamic shopping web sites with the inbuilt shopping cart system, store and manage shopping orders from small one product stores to expansive multi faceted inventories of thousands of items. Integrate with all common payment gateways via apis while storing required data in the cart formatted files.

**Show & Hide**

Another of the basic tools of dynamic web site creation is the ability to display data based on calculated criteria. The many methods familiar to most developers are available through the different WebDNA tools varying from direct comparisons through to multi faceted calculations.

**SQL**

Connect to MySQL databases to send queries and use retrieved data in the same effortless way that WebDNA manages it own builtin search results, or for those inclined, communicate directly to other databases that communicate via a standard ODBC connection.

**TCP Connections**

Most of the worldâ€™s HTTP communication is via TCP/IP, a layered set of packet-switched network protocols between computers and network devices. Messages can be exchanged between servers using TCP connections, WebDNA tools are able to provide these connections.

**Technical**

When it comes to working outside the typical web site and transacting with other programs installed on a web server WebDNA comes to the fore with considered access to 'shell' and 'dos' scripting. WebDNA also has tools that help developers create typical "technical based outcomes".

**Text Manipulation**

Text always needs to be manipulated in busy dynamic web sites. WebDNA has easy to use builtin tools to help you produce the exact results required when it comes to the demanding task of text formatting and verification

**XML**

XML is one of the most widely-used formats for sharing structured information today: between computers and programs, both locally and across networks. WebDNA enable developers to easily parse XML content both directly and using XSL styling of an XML document.

**BioType**

New to WebDNA v8.5, BioType is a behavioural biometrics function based on [ADGS](https://www.adgs.com/) research and development. BioType is based on the concept of behavioural biometrics, meaning the way people do things individually, such as speaking, writing, typing, walking styles.
